    <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>ToolMetric provides free, client-side PDF tools. All primary processing happens in the user's browser using JavaScript libraries such as pdf-lib. We do not upload your files to our servers, nor do we store processed files. This means we collect no personal files or document contents as part of normal tool usage.</p>

    <h2>Google AdSense & Third-Party Ads</h2>
    <p>We may display third-party ads such as Google AdSense. These advertising providers may use cookies and other technologies and may collect anonymous usage data. Ads are served by third parties and are subject to their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use minimal cookies for site functionality and analytics. Cookies may be set by third-party services (ad providers and analytics). You can control cookie settings in your browser.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>By design, ToolMetric does not collect or retain the content of PDF files you process. All operations are performed locally in your browser. We do collect basic anonymous analytics (page views, performance) if enabled. We do not collect document contents, uploads, or converted files.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may rely on third-party services for hosting, analytics, and advertising. Those services have their own privacy practices and may collect data as described in their policies.</p>

    <h2>GDPR & Data Subject Rights</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the EU, ToolMetric acts as a data controller for any personal data we process (e.g., analytics). You may request access, correction, or deletion of personal data by contacting us at the contact page. Because we do not process document files on our servers, file content removal requests are not applicable.</p>
